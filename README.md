# Histopathological_Prediction

About Dataset
The BreaKHis database contains microscopic biopsy images benign and malignant breast tumors, wherein this dataset, I have done to separate training data and test data with different folders, each file has a different slide image. In this dataset I only took a partial sample of 400x optical zoom, if you are further interested in the dataset, please refer to this paper:

Gitanjali Wadhwa, and Amandeep Kaur. "A Deep CNN Technique for Detection of Breast Cancer Using Histopathology Images." In 2020 Advanced Computing and Communication Technologies for High Performance Applications (ACCTHPA), pp. 179-185. IEEE, 2020.

Given this, the dataset is not in my control. This dataset purpose is to deep learning learner
